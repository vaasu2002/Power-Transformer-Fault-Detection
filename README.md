# Power Transformer Fault Detection
#### Abstract
Power transformer failures can be a serious issue, as they can cause power outages, damage to nearby equipment and structures and potentially pose a safety risk to people in the area. There are a number of factors that can contribute to transformer failures, including age, overloading, and environmental conditions. In order to prevent transformer failures, it is important to properly maintain and repair transformers, and to replace them when necessary.

#### Problem Statement
Power transformer failures can cause significant disruptions to electrical power distribution systems, and can be costly to repair or replace. In order to reduce the frequency and impact of transformer failures, it would be useful to have a method for predicting when a transformer is likely to fail.

#### Objective
-   Develop a machine learning model that can predict power transformer faults.
-   Design and implement a machine learning training pipeline. 
-   When new training data becomes available, a workflow that includes data validation, preprocessing, model training, analysis, and deployment will be triggered.
